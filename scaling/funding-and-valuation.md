## 1. Seed Stage: Laying the Foundation

### Funding Overview:
The seed stage is typically the first round of external funding a startup receives. At this point, the company has an idea but is still refining its product and market fit. The funding is often used for product development, market research, and building the core team.

- **Sources of Funding**: 
  - **Angel Investors**: Individual investors who provide early capital, often in exchange for equity.
  - **Seed Funds**: Venture capital firms that specialize in early-stage investments.
  - **Friends and Family**: Founders may also rely on personal networks for initial funding.
  - **Crowdfunding**: A more recent option, where startups raise small amounts of money from a large group of people.

- **Typical Funding Amount**: Seed round investments typically range from **$100K to $2M**. 
- **Valuation Range**: 
  - Startups in the seed stage typically have valuations between **$1M and $10M**. 
  - The valuation is often determined by factors such as the team's experience, the uniqueness of the product, the potential market size, and early traction or product development.

### Use of Funds:
- Building a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**.
- Hiring a small core team (engineers, designers, product managers).
- Conducting market research and validating product-market fit.

### Valuation Factors:
- **Founder Experience**: A strong founding team with prior startup success can command higher valuations.
- **Product Progress**: A working prototype or early customer feedback can justify a higher valuation.
- **Market Potential**: If the startup is tackling a large, untapped market, it can increase the valuation.

- Marketing efforts to drive user acquisition.
- Expanding the customer base and growing revenue.

### Valuation Factors:
- **Traction**: Metrics such as active users, revenue, or partnerships show the startup is on the right path.

- **Valuation Range**: 
  - Startups in Series B usually have valuations between **$50M and $200M**, depending on market share, revenue growth, and traction.

### Valuation Factors:
- **Revenue and Growth**: Investors look for consistent growth in revenue, customers, and other key metrics.

### Valuation Factors:
- **Revenue Growth and Profitability**: At this stage, startups should demonstrate a clear path to profitability or significant revenue streams.
