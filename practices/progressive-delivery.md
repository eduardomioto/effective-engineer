# Progressive Delivery

Progressive Delivery is a release management strategy designed to reduce risk during software deployment by delivering updates in smaller, incremental steps. This approach enables teams to monitor the effects of a release in real-time and ensure that issues can be detected and resolved early, minimizing downtime and disruptions for end users.

## What Is Progressive Delivery?  

Progressive Delivery involves progressively rolling out new features or updates to a subset of users before fully releasing them to the entire user base. This strategy allows teams to mitigate risk, gather feedback, and ensure system stability throughout the deployment process. Key components of Progressive Delivery include:  
- **Canary Releases**: Gradually rolling out a new version to a small subset of users.  
- **Feature Toggles**: Enabling or disabling specific features based on the environment or user.  [Go to a dedicated article](https://github.com/eduardomioto/effective-engineering/blob/main/practices/feature-flags.md)
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Deploying updates to a parallel environment and switching traffic between them.

## Benefits of Progressive Delivery  

1. **Reduced Risk**: By limiting the exposure of new features to a small audience initially, issues can be caught early and resolved without affecting all users.  
2. **Faster Feedback**: Teams can gather user feedback on new features quickly and make adjustments as necessary.  
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Progressive Delivery encourages frequent releases, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and agile development.  
4. **Better User Experience**: Users experience fewer disruptions, and the application can adapt quickly based on real-time data.

## Blue-Green Deployment: A Key Technique for Progressive Delivery  

One of the most popular techniques for Progressive Delivery is **Blue-Green Deployment**. This method involves maintaining two identical production environments: the "blue" environment (the current live version) and the "green" environment (the new version). The idea is to minimize downtime during deployments by switching traffic from one environment to the other seamlessly.

### How Blue-Green Deployment Works  
1. **Deploy the New Version to Green**: The new version of the application is deployed to the green environment, while the blue environment continues to serve live traffic.
2. **Test in Green**: Quality assurance (QA) and other automated tests are executed in the green environment to ensure the new version works as expected.
3. **Switch Traffic**: Once the green environment is tested and ready, traffic is switched from the blue environment to the green environment.
4. **Monitor**: The team monitors the green environment closely to ensure everything functions smoothly and to catch any potential issues early.
5. **Rollback**: If issues arise, the traffic can be switched back to the blue environment, effectively rolling back the deployment.

This process enables a smooth transition between versions, ensuring that users experience little to no downtime during the deployment process.

## Blue-Green Deployment on AWS  

AWS provides various tools and services to implement Blue-Green Deployments efficiently. Here's how to implement Blue-Green deployments using AWS services:

### 1. **Set Up Two Identical Environments (Blue and Green)**  

You can use AWS services like **Elastic Beanstalk**, **Amazon EC2**, or **Amazon ECS** (Elastic Container Service) to create two identical environments: one for the current live version (blue) and one for the new version (green). Both environments should be configured identically, with identical resources, such as load balancers, databases, and application code.

- **Elastic Beanstalk**: A fully managed service that handles deployment, scaling, and monitoring. You can easily create two environments for Blue-Green deployment by leveraging Elastic Beanstalk's environment versioning and deployment features.
- **Amazon EC2**: Manually configure two sets of EC2 instances for the blue and green environments. You can manage routing between environments using an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
- **Amazon ECS**: If you're using containers, you can create two identical ECS services (one for blue and one for green), using **AWS Fargate** or EC2 instances for container orchestration.

### 2. **Configure AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**  

Use **Elastic Load Balancing** (ELB) to distribute traffic between the blue and green environments. During a Blue-Green deployment, ELB can route traffic to one environment at a time, and you can switch traffic with minimal downtime.

- Configure the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** or **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** to point to both the blue and green environments.
- When ready, update the load balancer to direct traffic to the green environment.
- If problems arise, quickly revert the load balancer to the blue environment for rollback.

### 3. **Deploy the New Version to the Green Environment**  

Once the blue environment is running smoothly, deploy the new version to the green environment. This can be done by updating the code in the green environment, running tests, and validating that the new version works as expected.

You can use AWS **CodePipeline** for automated deployment pipelines, integrating with services like **CodeBuild** and **CodeDeploy** to deploy the new version to the green environment.

### 4. **Switch Traffic from Blue to Green**  

When the green environment is ready, switch the traffic from blue to green. This can be done by updating the routing rules in the ELB or by promoting the green environment to be the live environment.

- For **Elastic Beanstalk**, you can simply swap the CNAME (canonical name) of the environments to switch traffic.
- For **EC2** or **ECS**, update the routing rules in the ELB or ECS service to route traffic to the green environment.

### 5. **Monitor the Green Environment**  

After switching traffic to the green environment, monitor it closely for issues like performance degradation, errors, or bugs. AWS provides tools like **CloudWatch** for monitoring logs, metrics, and alarms.

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Collect and analyze logs from your application in real-time.
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Set up alarms for key metrics like response times, error rates, and resource usage to detect any potential issues.
- **AWS X-Ray**: If you're running microservices, use X-Ray for distributed tracing to monitor the performance and behavior of requests across services.

### 6. **Rollback if Necessary**  

If any issues arise during the Blue-Green deployment, you can quickly roll back to the blue environment. Because both environments are identical, this rollback process is fast and seamless, with minimal disruption to users.

You can also automate rollbacks in your deployment pipeline with **AWS CodeDeploy**, which offers built-in support for automatic rollback in case of deployment failures.

## Best Practices for Blue-Green Deployments  

1. **Automate Testing**: Automate the testing process in the green environment to ensure that everything works as expected before switching traffic.
2. **Monitor After Switch**: Continuously monitor the green environment for performance or error issues after the switch.
3. **Implement Rollback Procedures**: Always have a clear rollback procedure in place to switch traffic back to the blue environment if needed.
4. **Use Infrastructure as Code**: Use **AWS CloudFormation** or **Terraform** to manage the blue and green environments as code, ensuring repeatability and consistency.
5. **Leverage CloudWatch**: Set up CloudWatch metrics and alarms for the green environment to detect issues early.
