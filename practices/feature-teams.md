# Feature Teams

## Overview
Feature teams are cross-functional teams responsible for the end-to-end delivery of a specific feature. Each team is composed of a leader, a QA person, a Product Owner (PO), and developers.

## Team Composition
- **Leader**: Responsible for coordinating the team and ensuring the feature is delivered on time.
- **QA Person**: Ensures the quality of the feature through rigorous testing.
- **Product Owner (PO)**: Represents the stakeholders and ensures the feature meets business requirements.
- **Developers**: Implement the feature according to the specifications.

## Communication Channels
To facilitate effective communication, each feature team will have dedicated and temporary channels on Slack:

### Dedicated Temporary Channels
- **#feature-[feature-name]**: Used during the grooming, development, QA to discuss requirements and scope.

## Workflow
1. **Grooming**: The team discusses and refines the feature requirements in the grooming channel.
2. **Development**: Developers implement the feature, coordinating efforts in the development channel.
3. **Quality Assurance**: The QA person tests the feature, and any issues are addressed in the QA channel.
4. **Production**: The feature is deployed to production, and the team uses the production channel for any post-release activities.

By following this structure, feature teams can ensure efficient communication and successful delivery of features from inception to production.
