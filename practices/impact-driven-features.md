# Impact-Driven Prioritization Method

## Introduction
The impact-driven prioritization method is a strategic approach to software development where the team focuses on features that have the biggest potential impact on the business. This method is particularly useful for teams with limited resources, as it ensures that the most valuable work is completed first.

## Benefits
- **Maximizes Business Value**: By prioritizing features that have the highest impact, the team ensures that their efforts are aligned with business goals.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Helps in making the best use of limited resources by focusing on high-impact tasks.
- **Improved Decision Making**: Provides a clear framework for making prioritization decisions.

## Impact-Effort Matrix
The impact-effort matrix is a tool used to visualize and prioritize tasks based on their potential impact and the effort required to complete them. 

### Matrix Quadrants
1. **Quick Wins**: High impact, low effort. These tasks should be prioritized first.
2. **Major Projects**: High impact, high effort. These tasks are important but require significant resources.
3. **Fill-Ins**: Low impact, low effort. These tasks can be done if there is extra time.
4. **Thankless Tasks**: Low impact, high effort. These tasks should be deprioritized or avoided.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Identify Potential Features**: List all potential features or tasks.
2. **Assess Impact**: Evaluate the potential impact of each feature on the business.
3. **Estimate Effort**: Estimate the effort required to implement each feature.
4. **Prioritize Using the Matrix**: Place each feature in the appropriate quadrant of the impact-effort matrix.
5. **Execute**: Focus on completing tasks in the Quick Wins quadrant first, followed by Major Projects.

## Conclusion
The impact-driven prioritization method helps teams with limited resources to focus on the most valuable work, ensuring that their efforts have the greatest possible impact on the business. By using tools like the impact-effort matrix, teams can make informed decisions and prioritize effectively.
