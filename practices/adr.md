# Architectural Decision Records (ADR): A Guide to Documenting Decisions  

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are lightweight documents that capture key architectural decisions made during a project's lifecycle. They provide a historical context for decisions, enabling teams to maintain transparency, align on goals, and revisit or adjust decisions as the project evolves.

## What Is an ADR?  

An ADR is a structured document that explains:  
1. **What** decision was made.  
2. **Why** the decision was made.  
3. **How** the decision was implemented.  

It is a way to document the reasoning behind architectural choices, making them traceable and easy to understand for current and future team members.

## Why Use ADRs?  

- **Documentation**: Keeps a record of important technical decisions.  
- **Communication**: Ensures alignment within the team and with stakeholders.  
- **Transparency**: Provides visibility into the rationale behind decisions.  
- **Continuity**: Helps onboard new team members and minimizes knowledge loss.

## Components of an ADR  

A typical ADR contains the following sections:  

### 1. **Title**  
   - A short, descriptive title summarizing the decision.  

### 2. **Context**  
   - The problem, opportunity, or situation leading to the decision.  
   - Relevant constraints, requirements, or background information.  

### 3. **Decision**  
   - The chosen solution or approach.  

### 4. **Consequences**  
   - Positive and negative outcomes of the decision.  
   - Trade-offs and potential risks.  

### 5. **Alternatives Considered**  
   - Other approaches evaluated and why they were not chosen.  

### 6. **Date**  
   - The date when the decision was made.  

### 7. **Status**  
   - Current status of the decision (e.g., proposed, accepted, deprecated).

## Example of an ADR

# ADR 001: Use REST for API Communication  

## Context  
Our application requires a communication mechanism between the frontend and backend. The solution must be easy to implement, widely understood, and compatible with existing infrastructure.  

## Decision  
We decided to use REST (Representational State Transfer) as the API communication protocol.  

## Consequences  
### Positive  
- Simple and widely supported by tools and libraries.  
- Easy to consume for third-party integrations.  

### Negative  
- Limited support for real-time communication compared to WebSockets.  

## Alternatives Considered  
1. **GraphQL**: Offers more flexibility but introduces additional complexity.  
2. **gRPC**: High performance but less familiar to the team.  

## Status  
Accepted
