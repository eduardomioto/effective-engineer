## The Effective Engineering <a name="effective-engineering"></a>

In a broader scope, Effectiveness is the capability of producing a desired result or the ability to produce desired output. When something is deemed effective, it means it has an intended or expected outcome, or produces a deep, vivid impression.[1]

However, the software industry has a different approach to define Effectiveness. The effectiveness in Software Engineering is directly associated to the Impact Produced by an engineer, so the outcome produced by this person. [2]

Measuring and improving engineering effectiveness is a precondition to building a healthy engineering team: attracting talent, building an efficient system where they can produce their best work, and retaining that talent. What teams do with their time is the primary factor in determining its output. Even if you hire the best engineers, if they spend all their time on the wrong things, or they’re constantly interrupted while trying to do the right things, the team won’t succeed. [3]

### Managerial Accountability <a name="managerial-accountability"></a>

Managers should be held accountable for building productive teams. In particular, managers should both provide a system to measure productivity and lead the changes that need to happen. [3]

As a manager, it can be hard to remember what it was like to need primarily Maker Time to succeed because a manager’s role can be significantly more interrupt-driven.  To be most effective engineers require large blocks of uninterrupted time and for them any interruptions are disproportionately costly. [3]

### Reducing Interruptions

Software projects typically require engineers to have several concepts and context in their memory to make forward progress. A task might require you to read a ticket with requirements, look at log output, read related code before you're able to start making changes. Any interruption causes an expensive context switch that forces you to start this whole process over. [3]

#### Flow State
Flow state or being in the zone means having no worries about imminent interruptions - you’re fully in the moment and at your most productive. Fragmentation and interruptions kill flow state because context switching is so expensive for engineers. This state is typically where the most work gets done and it’s when the hardest problems can get solved. [3]

Because it takes time to get enough context to make forward progress on a task, we’ve found that the minimum unit of time that allows for flow state is 2 hours. Two hours of uninterrupted time is called Maker Time. It is certainly possible to achieve flow state in shorter periods of time but that’s typically an exception. Periods longer than 2 hours can also lead to higher quality flow states. [3]
