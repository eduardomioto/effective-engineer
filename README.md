## The Effective Engineering <a name="effective-engineering"></a>

In a broader scope, Effectiveness is the capability of producing a desired result or the ability to produce desired output. When something is deemed effective, it means it has an intended or expected outcome, or produces a deep, vivid impression.[1]

However, the software industry has a different approach to define Effectiveness. The effectiveness in Software Engineering is directly associated to the Impact Produced by an engineer, so the outcome produced by this person. [2]

Measuring and improving engineering effectiveness is a precondition to building a healthy engineering team: attracting talent, building an efficient system where they can produce their best work, and retaining that talent. What teams do with their time is the primary factor in determining its output. Even if you hire the best engineers, if they spend all their time on the wrong things, or they’re constantly interrupted while trying to do the right things, the team won’t succeed. [3]

### Managerial Accountability <a name="managerial-accountability"></a>

Managers should be held accountable for building productive teams. In particular, managers should both provide a system to measure productivity and lead the changes that need to happen. [3]

As a manager, it can be hard to remember what it was like to need primarily Maker Time to succeed because a manager’s role can be significantly more interrupt-driven.  To be most effective engineers require large blocks of uninterrupted time and for them any interruptions are disproportionately costly. [3]

#### Reducing Interruptions

Software projects typically require engineers to have several concepts and context in their memory to make forward progress. A task might require you to read a ticket with requirements, look at log output, read related code before you're able to start making changes. Any interruption causes an expensive context switch that forces you to start this whole process over. [3] 

#### Flow State
Flow state or being in the zone means having no worries about imminent interruptions - you’re fully in the moment and at your most productive. Fragmentation and interruptions kill flow state because context switching is so expensive for engineers. This state is typically where the most work gets done and it’s when the hardest problems can get solved. [3]

Because it takes time to get enough context to make forward progress on a task, we’ve found that the minimum unit of time that allows for flow state is 2 hours. Two hours of uninterrupted time is called Maker Time. It is certainly possible to achieve flow state in shorter periods of time but that’s typically an exception. Periods longer than 2 hours can also lead to higher quality flow states. [3]

#### Possible Solutions

A very important component of the Netflix Freedom & Responsibility culture [4] is “Context, not Control”, in other words, “high performance people will do better work if they understand the context.” In practice, this means that if your team is aware of their purpose and how it aligns to the company’s and/or organization’s priorities, they will make good decisions and will accomplish great things, without a “helicopter manager” hovering over their heads and dictating everything that must be done.  When the team has the appropriate context, we trust them to make decisions that are in the best interest of Netflix. We provide team members the appropriate context around projects and priorities so that they can identify what’s most important in their queue of projects and tasks. [5]

Adopt an OOPS rotation. Many teams (ours included) at Netflix subscribe to the “operate what you build” approach to DevOps. We use an OOPS (Operations, On-Call and Partner Support) rotation, whereby we have one member of the team on-call for a week at a time to handle all production issues, pipeline management, partner support questions and anything else out of the ordinary that arises.  This allows the other members of the team to focus on project work and avoid interruptions and context switching. We build the OOPS week into each person’s project schedule and the intent is that no project work is done during the week that someone is on-call. If the on-call person does happen to have excess bandwidth, we try to focus on paying off technical debt and ensuring alignment across the dozen or so services that we support. [5]

### Confidence Factor

Developing confidence and security in a competitive, exponential and agile environment is not an easy task. That's why Fabossi created the concept of the 4 dimensions, which will lead you and your team to the best results: [6]

- _1st dimension: Self-confidence_. Since no one can give what they don't have, knowing and trusting yourself is the starting point for building trusting relationships, a journey that involves self-knowledge and authenticity. [6]

- _2nd dimension: Personal trust_. Our actions need to be in line with our words. This dimension is linked to our ethics, our values and our principles, and is shown in the attitudes we take on a daily basis. [6]

- _3rd dimension: Interpersonal trust_. We are relational beings, we live on relationships. Empathy, equity and genuine interest are fundamental ingredients for this dimension to be established. [6]

- _4th dimension: Achievement confidence_. It involves the skills that lead us to achieve extraordinary results. But when talking about trust, the ways to achieve them are as important as the results. Aimed at professionals who occupy leadership positions or who act as agents of motivation and engagement of people on a day-to-day basis, The trust factor will help you to find the way to become a true leader. [6]

#### Psychological safety and Confidence

In a study conducted by Google, the researchers had to determine how to quantitatively measure effectiveness. They looked at lines of code written, bugs fixed, customer satisfaction, and more. But Google’s leaders, who had initially pushed for objective effectiveness measures, realized that every suggested measure could be inherently flawed - **more lines of code aren’t necessarily a good thing and more bugs fixed means more bugs were initially created**. [7]

Instead, the team decided to use a combination of qualitative assessments and quantitative measures. For qualitative assessments, the researchers captured input from three different perspectives - executives, team leads, and team members. While they all were asked to rate teams on similar scales, when asked to explain their ratings, their answers showed that each was focused on different aspects when assessing team effectiveness. [7]

Executives were most concerned with results (e.g., sales numbers or product launches), but team members said that team culture was the most important measure of team effectiveness. Fittingly, the team lead’s concept of effectiveness spanned both the big picture and the individuals’ concerns saying that ownership, vision, and goals were the most important measures. [7]

Using input from executives across the globe, the research team identified 180 teams to study (115 project teams in engineering and 65 pods in sales) which included a mix of high- and low-performing teams. The study tested how both team composition (e.g., personality traits, sales skills, demographics on the team) and team dynamics (e.g., what it was like to work with teammates) impact team effectiveness. Ideas were pulled from existing research as well as Google’s own experience with what makes an effective team. [7]

They conducted hundreds of double-blind interviews with leaders to get a sense of what they thought drove team effectiveness. The researchers then looked at existing survey data, including over 250 items from the annual employee engagement survey and gDNA, Google’s longitudinal study on work and life, to see what variables might be related to effectiveness. [7]

With all of this data, the team ran statistical models to understand which of the many inputs collected actually impacted team effectiveness. Using over 35 different statistical models on hundreds of variables, they sought to identify factors that: [7]

- _impacted multiple outcome metrics, both qualitative and quantitative_
- _surfaced for different kinds of teams across the organization_
- _showed consistent, robust statistical significance_

The researchers found that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together. **In order of importance**: [7]

- _Psychological safety_: Psychological safety refers to an individual’s perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk or a belief that a team is safe for risk taking in the face of being seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or disruptive. In a team with high psychological safety, teammates feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel confident that no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea. [7]

- _Dependability_: On dependable teams, members reliably complete quality work on time (vs the opposite - shirking responsibilities). [7]

- _Structure and clarity_: An individual’s understanding of job expectations, the process for fulfilling these expectations, and the consequences of one’s performance are important for team effectiveness. Goals can be set at the individual or group level, and must be specific, challenging, and attainable. Google often uses Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to help set and communicate short and long term goals. [7]

- _Meaning_: Finding a sense of purpose in either the work itself or the output is important for team effectiveness. The meaning of work is personal and can vary: financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, or self-expression for each individual, for example. [7]

- _Impact_: The results of one’s work, the subjective judgement that your work is making a difference, is important for teams. Seeing that one’s work is contributing to the organization’s goals can help reveal impact. [7]

### Product Manager Accountability <a name="product-manager-accountability"></a>

#### Prioritize Regularly

In accordance with Edmond Lau [2][8]:
- Opportunity cost of working on wrong ideas can set back growth by years.
- Prioritize tasks based on ROI.
- Regular prioritization is high leverage activity.
- Focus on what directly produces value.
- Learn to say no.
- Find ways to get into flow. “A state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems.”
- When possible, preserve larger blocks of focused time in the team schedule.
- Limit the amount of Work in Progress.
- Cost of context switching is high.
- Prioritizing is difficult.
- Prioritization is high leverage. It has huge impact on your ability to get right things done.
